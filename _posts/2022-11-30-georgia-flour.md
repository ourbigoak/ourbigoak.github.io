This fall I've been pleased to begin using local flour in some of our whole wheat mixes, notably our Whole Wheat and Country Seedy Sourdoughs, our pie crusts, and our bagels. This is a soft red wheat grown in Cochran, GA by [Back To The Basics](https://www.backtothebasics101.com/) so we blend it with our usual organic hard winter wheat flours, this wheat has a wonderful texture and fresh nuttier flavor that I think you'll start to recognize in our breads. What a joy to foster local & personal sources for ingredients to share with you!
