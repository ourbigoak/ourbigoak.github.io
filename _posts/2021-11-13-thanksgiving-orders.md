I'm so thankful this season for the laughter, joy, and closeness of family. I'm also thankful for all of your support and encouragement. I'll be  taking this week off, and am now accepting orders for a special Wednesday pickup the day before Thanksgiving, November 24th from 12pm-5pm - place your orders by evening that Monday.

<a href="/order" class="more-link btn btn-danger btn-large">Order now...</a>

Continued thanks to Donna at The Market Collective for hosting our pickup. I'll be focused on fall pies, so not all of our usual other desserts are available for this week, but breads and croissants to go along with your holiday celebrations are all ready for your enjoyment.
