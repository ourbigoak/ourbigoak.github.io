We're excited to have our first real day at the market this coming Saturday, May 7th. We'll have a wide variety of fresh baked goods, including:

 * Sourdough whole wheat boules
 * Dark Rye loaves
 * Baguettes
 * Rye crackers
 * Cinnamon rolls and cinnamon raisin bread

Hope to see you at the downtown Milledgeville market pavilion between 9am and noon this Saturday!
