We've had a great summer of happy responses to our breads at farmers markets in Milledgeville and Macon, thank you all! Now we're excited to offer an additional way to get our bread every week in Milledgeville: [online ordering](/order), delivered to an easy pickup location Wednesday afternoons at Blackbird Coffee in downtown. As always, the bread is baked fresh that day, and we'll offer the same variety of breads and pastries we bring to market.

We love our farmers markets and the active communities they foster around local food and awareness, so you'll continue to see us out at Milledgeville at the Green Market and in Macon at Mulberry Market, and continue to appreciate your support everywhere we see you in town!
