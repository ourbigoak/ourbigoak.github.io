A Milly Free Fridge Donation in your order gets multiplied in a couple of ways: first, we bake double that much for the week, helping us balance out batches and orders; second, we buy healthy ingredients to turn our breads into sandwiches ready to eat, along with cookies and pies; finally, we donate a third of the dollar amount back to the fridge project to cover other expenses and needs. Your donations have fed our community hundreds of times this year, and it brightens my day that you’ve helped bring the same quality baked goods you enjoy to the most food insecure in our town.

The Milly Free Fridge is a community solidarity project, and I’ll ask you to consider helping directly as well - many volunteers giving what they can have made this a success, there are many ways you can <a href="https://millyfreefridge.weebly.com/support.html">donate</a> or bring extra waters or utensils or fruit to the fridge at 601 S Wilkinson St, or commit to weekly making a few extra prepared meals labeled with description and date. The project is adding new fridges this summer, which will make it even more convenient for more folks to match the real need for food we see in the community.
