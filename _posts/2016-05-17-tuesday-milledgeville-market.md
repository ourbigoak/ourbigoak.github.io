Listen to that rain pour down! We'll be at the Milledgeville Main Street Farmers Market this afternoon from 2-6pm at the downtown pavilion, combining that fresh clean rain smell with our fresh baked:
 * Sourdough Boules
 * Baguettes
 * Chocolate cookies, chocolate frosting
 * Cheddar Puff Crackers
 * Bialys, an onion-topped bagel-like roll.
 
Come say hi and take some home!
