We're well into July now, it's hot but the earlier you come to the market the cooler it'll be in the breezy shade of the pavilion.
 * Whole Wheat Sourdough Boules
 * Rye Sourdough Boules
 * Cinnamon Rolls
 * Baguettes, whole wheat and all white
 * Bagels, topped with sesame seeds or poppy seeds
 * Peaches and Cream Tarts
 
Hope you're having a great summer - wouldn't some fresh baked bread and treats make it sweeter?
