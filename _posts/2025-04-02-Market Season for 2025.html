Our Big Oak will also be at Macon's <a href="https://www.poplarstfarmersmarket.com/">Poplar Street Farmers Market</a> most months, <a href="/subscribe">subscribe to our weekly announcement newsletter for all the details as the season proceeds. As always, you can order for pickup in Milledgeville or at market every week we're baking.  We're lucky to have good local produce growers supported by these markets, and hope you'll make them a regular part of your schedule!
