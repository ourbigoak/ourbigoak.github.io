Good seasons continue for Our Big Oak and local food in Middle Georgia. This summer you can find us in Milledgeville at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/the.milly.market">The Milly Market</a> on First and Third Fridays, and at Macon's <a href="https://www.poplarstfarmersmarket.com/">Poplar Street Farmers Market</a> on the Second and Fourth Wednesdays. You can order ahead for either market in the week before, and Milledgeville customers have options for in-town pickup every week.

<a href="/order" class="more-link btn btn-danger btn-large">Order for pickup today.</a>
